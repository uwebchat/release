Release notes:


uWebChat 1.9.1.1 fixes/adds/updates:
 

[UPDATE] uWebChat Core 1.9.1.1: Production API's for Save to OneDrive are now being used
The API calls to save chats to OneDrive are now using the production version instead of the beta functionality. Extra logging has also been added to the application, making the troubleshooting of the save to OneDrive issues easier.

[FIX] uWebChat Front-End 1.1.0.0: Google Chrome and Google Pay autocomplete has been removed
If a customer has any Google Pay/Credit Card information saved in the browser, it was being filled in when writing down your name on the Hello screen of uWebChat. Applied a fix to remove the autocomplete for it.

[ADDED] uWebChat Core 1.9.1.1 & uWebChat Front-End 1.1.0.0: Persistent chat across a site, including clean-up after disconnect
uWebChat now contains persistent chats. If a customer navigates to a different page, the chat will continue on the new location. If a chat is disconnected, the session will be removed, so new chats can be started if needed.

[ADDED] uWebChat Core 1.9.1.1: Hunting methods for groups
The default hunting method in uWebChat was Serial. In this version a new hunting method has been introduced: Round Robin Random. With this, the agent hunting will be more random then with serial. To change the hunting method, just type edit group and select the hunting method option there. 

[FIX] uWebChat Core 1.9.1.1: Display names (with comma) gave issues when adding to a group
If a display name contained a comma (for example: Doe, John) - then adding that agent to the group gave an error. This has been fixed in this version.

[FIX] uWebChat Core 1.9.1.1: Help adaptive card wasn't working on mobile devices
The help adaptive card wasn't working on the mobile client of Teams. In this version that has been fixed.
